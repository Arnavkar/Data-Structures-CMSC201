Assignment: Build a frequency counter and test Zipfâ€™s law using test files. Also test the efficieny of a Sequential Search Symbol Table
with a Self-Organizing Symbol Table that puts the most recently accessed entry at the front of the queue.

Collaboration Statement: I worked on this myself apart from the implementation of mergesort for linked lists. For that I went online to
coding simplified and watched some videos to break down how the various functions to accomplish mergesort on a linked list would work before
implementing it into my own code for both the SequentialsearchST and the Selforganizing ST.
